## ✅ Best Practices

- 🧼 Keep documentation clear and up-to-date
- 🧩 Break content into focused files — avoid large monolithic docs
- 📎 Link files in the main `README.md` or use a sidebar if hosted
- 📁 Use folders if needed (e.g., `docs/admin/`, `docs/api/`, `docs/setup/`)

---

## 📌 Notes

- Markdown format (`.md`) is preferred for easy editing and GitHub rendering
- You can integrate with tools like **Swagger**, **Redoc**, or **MkDocs** for auto-generated or browsable docs
- Internal-only content (e.g., secrets, local-only setup steps) should be marked clearly
