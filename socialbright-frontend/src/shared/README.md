# üì¶ Shared Folder

The `shared/` folder contains all **reusable logic, layouts, components, constants, services, context, hooks, and utilities** used throughout the SocialBright application. Everything in this folder is designed to be tenant-aware, accessible, and fully consistent with SocialBright‚Äôs UI and backend standards.

This folder ensures **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** principles across all roles (Case Manager, Admin, Superuser), pages, and features.

## ‚úÖ Usage Guidelines

- Always import from `@shared/...` using aliases to avoid long relative paths.
- Keep this folder clean ‚Äî do not put page-specific or role-specific logic here.
- All code here should support **multi-tenancy** and use **Tailwind CSS** styling conventions.
- Group logic and files by purpose, not by page.

---

## üîÅ Example Usage

```jsx
// Layout
import PrivateLayout from '@shared/layouts/PrivateLayout';

// Context
import { useAuth } from '@shared/context/AuthContext';

// Service
import { getClientsForTenant } from '@shared/services/clientService';

// Constant
import { ROLES } from '@shared/constants/roles';

// Util
import { calculateAge } from '@shared/utils/dateUtils';

// Hook
import { useDebounce } from '@shared/hooks/useDebounce';
```

## üîç Multi-Tenant Notes

Use TenantContext or useTenant() in services, components, and utils that behave differently by tenant.  
For program names (e.g., NH Easy, ACCESS NYC), use constants or helpers in tenantUtils.js.  

---

## üö® Best Practices
Keep files small and focused ‚Äî split files if they grow too large.  
Use consistent naming conventions (PascalCase for components, camelCase for functions).  
Avoid hardcoding ‚Äî all repeated values (dropdowns, roles, etc.) should come from constants/.  

---

## üîÑ To Do
 
 Create unit tests for key services and utils  
 Add documentation for tenant override logic  
 Create shared modal and tooltip components  

---

## üßº Naming Conventions

Components: PascalCase.jsx  
Context / Hooks / Utils / Services: camelCase.js  
All exports should be named exports unless a layout or React component
