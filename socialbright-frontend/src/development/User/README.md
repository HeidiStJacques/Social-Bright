# ðŸ‘¤ Development â€“ User Pages

This folder contains in-development components and layouts related to **case managers and regular users** within the SocialBright platform. These pages represent tools used by front-line staff to manage clients, notes, tasks, calendars, and care plans.

- **Calendar**

- **Dashboard**
- **Demographics**
- **Eligibility**
- **Providers**
- **Reports**
- **Status Form**
- **Tasks**

## ðŸ§ª Purpose

These pages are:
- **In development** â€” not yet merged into the production `/src/user` folder.
- **Meant for internal testing and feedback**
- Designed to evolve rapidly based on team input and real-world workflows

---

## ðŸ–¼ Screenshots

Screenshots and walkthroughs will be added to this folder to support documentation and visual QA.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- These pages are connected to **multi-tenant**, **role-based access control** logic.
- Most components rely on client selection from a dashboard or global context.
- Sensitive tenant details should be **abstracted** before pushing public code.

---

## ðŸ§¼ Cleanup Reminder

Once components here are finalized:
- Move them into `/src/user/`
- Update routing and layout imports
- Delete outdated versions from this folder

---

## ðŸ“£ Collaboration

Pull requests, reviews, and feedback are encouraged as these tools are core to daily user workflows.
