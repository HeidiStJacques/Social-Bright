# 🔐 SocialBright – Superuser Panel (Development)

This folder contains the **in-development Superuser pages** for the SocialBright platform. These pages are designed for SocialBright system administrators to oversee tenant accounts, system-wide analytics, and backend configuration — separate from tenant-level admin tools.

---

## ✅ Pages Included (WIP)

- **Accounts**
- **Analytics**
- **Dashboard**
- **Maintenance**
- **New Users**
- **System Logs**
- **System Settings**
- **Tenant Features**
- **Tenants**

---

## 🧠 Purpose

Unlike tenant-level Admin pages, Superuser pages are intended for **SocialBright internal staff** to manage the overall infrastructure:

- Create/edit tenant organizations
- Configure tenant features or limits
- Monitor global activity
- View and manage all system-level data

---

## ⚙️ Development Info

- Location:  
  `src/dev/superuser/`

- Current status: Actively in development using mock data and planned backend integration
- Styling follows the universal SocialBright layout
- Sidebar and dashboard design align with Admin and CM dashboards

---

## 🔒 Access Control

These pages are reserved for users with a `superuser` role and should not be visible or accessible to regular tenant admins or users.

---

## 🚧 Notes

- May use placeholder cards or tables
- Built with multi-tenant awareness
- Will include system analytics and real-time control in future builds
