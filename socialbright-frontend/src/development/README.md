# 🛠 Development Pages (src/development)

This folder contains all experimental or in-progress components and features that are under active development and testing. These files may not yet be production-ready but are crucial for prototyping, collaborating, and validating new ideas.

---

## 📁 Structure

The `src/development` directory includes:

- **Admin Pages**: Pre-release versions of administrative dashboards and tools.
- **Public Pages**: Pages visible to unauthenticated users (e.g., marketing content, landing pages).
- **Superuser Pages**: Advanced backend control panels built for the SocialBright superuser team.
- **Prototype Features**: Experimental components and layouts that are being tested before being merged into core product modules.

---

## 🧪 Purpose

These pages serve as a **sandbox environment** for:

- Testing UI/UX concepts
- Iterating on new workflows
- Collaborating on new features before they’re live
- Safely experimenting without affecting production

---

## 📌 Notes

- Do **not** rely on the components here for live or production environments.
- Code in this folder may be unstable or incomplete.
- Finalized features will be moved to their respective permanent folders (`/src/admin`, `/src/public`, `/src/superuser`, etc.).

---

## 🧼 Cleanup

Old or deprecated components in this folder may be removed or archived periodically to keep the development space lean.

---

## 🔐 Access

While this directory is part of the codebase, access to certain development components may still depend on:
- **User roles**
- **Tenant configurations**
- **Backend flags or feature toggles**

---

## 📬 Feedback

If you're testing or reviewing anything from this folder, feel free to leave comments, raise issues, or create pull requests with improvements. Everything in here is a work in progress and open to collaboration.
